## Metis Project 5: COVID-19 and Household Gender Equality

by [Matt Ranalletta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewranalletta/)

## Summary

For this project, I combined aggregated data from a Facebook survey on household gender equality with worldwide COVID-19 case data through July 2020, which is when the survey was taken.

## Methodologies

1. Combined survey data with COVID-19 case data.
2. Performed exploratory data analysis and cleaning.
3. Used regression modeling techniques (linear, polynomial, Lasso, Ridge) to do initial modeling.
4. Feature engineered and removed outliers to find the best model.
5. Visualized results in Tableau and Google Slides.
